    <br><h2><a href="https://www.hostinger.com/">Hostinger</a></h2>
    <ul>
        <li>After doing some research, I chose Hostinger to host my small business' website. 
            I checked Google, Forbes, and Reddit to get some varied results, 
            but mostly relied on Reddit as I know companies can pay Google to promote their site, 
            and I got a feeling Forbes did too based on some descriptions they provided. 
            I also cross-referenced Forbes' specified companies with what people on Reddit had said
            to find out that some of them are actually not that great. Hostinger appears to offer
            deals frequently (monthly plans are ~$10 off this week, for example), and was stated
            to be a great choice for small businesses, based on my research. It provides perks like
            unlimited free SSL, a free business email (with marketing), and offers its own software 
            with AI tools to help build your website.</li><br>
        <li>Monthly Cost: $12.19/mo (without discount / pre-paid plans can also be as low as $10.99/mo)</li><br>
        <li>Domain: FREE (cost varies after 1yr - based on if .com, .org, etc. was chosen)</li><br>
        <li>Hostinger pretty much includes all the basics that I'd need for a small business,
            but I noticed I might need to buy an e-commerce extension or add-on (like WooCommerce since 
            WordPress is also supported), as it is not provided in their standard plan. I could 
            either upgrade or consider cheaper options, like if I were to use Snipcart beyond the
            testing plan (though price is based on # of sales, and theoretically I am a small
            business just beginning). I found a couple options though, called OpenCart and
            PrestaShop, that are free, open-source, and have the capability to integrate with
            Hostinger.</li><br>
        <li>I think I'd prefer basic CSP, based on my research above. It also makes more sense to me
            for a flower shop.</li>
    </ul>
